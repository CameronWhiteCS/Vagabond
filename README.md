# About

Vagabond is a peer-to-peer social network built using the [ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/REC-activitypub-20180123/) protocol. By design, Vagabond protects user privacy by offering:
* User defined blacklists to restrict the destinations of outbound traffic
* Support for sending and receiving encrypted messages using public key cryptography
* Ephemeral identities to mask post history
* Minimal bundle size and efficient AJAX requests to accommodate users of TOR and other anonymity networks
* Automatic stripping of image metadata prior to being stored server-side
* The ability to erase all user data at any time, immediately, and with no questions asked
* The ability to request a complete copy of all user data free of charge
